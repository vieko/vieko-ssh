# vieko-ssh

The [vieko.dev](https://vieko.dev) one-pager, served over SSH.

```
ssh vieko.dev
```

Browse recent writing without leaving the terminal — no install, just `ssh`.
It's the sibling of [`@vieko/cli`](https://github.com/vieko/vieko-cli) (the
`npx` version): same layout, same keys, delivered as a public SSH TUI instead
of a package. Built with [Charm's `wish`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish)
+ [`bubbletea`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

## Keys

| Key         | Action                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `↑`/`k`     | Move up                   |
| `↓`/`j`     | Move down                 |
| `Enter`     | Surface selected post URL |
| `g`         | Surface GitHub URL        |
| `x`         | Surface X URL             |
| `e`         | Surface email             |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit                      |

Post titles and footer links are emitted as OSC-8 hyperlinks, so in a
supporting terminal you can ⌘/ctrl-click them directly. Activating an item also
prints its URL in a status line for easy copying — there's no browser to launch
on the server side, so we hand the URL back to *your* terminal instead.

## Run locally

```sh
go run . 
# then, in another shell:
ssh localhost -p 2222
```

Config via env: `VIEKO_SSH_HOST` (default `0.0.0.0`), `VIEKO_SSH_PORT`
(default `2222`), `VIEKO_SSH_HOST_KEY` (default `.ssh/id_ed25519`, generated on
first run).

## Layout

```
main.go                     wish server + hardened middleware stack
internal/content/           the data — hand-mirrored from vieko.dev
internal/tui/               bubbletea model (port of vieko-cli's render loop)
deploy/                     systemd unit, nftables ruleset, deploy script
```

## Security posture

This is an intentionally public, **anonymous**, read-only TUI pointed at the
open internet. That's close to a worst-case exposure profile, so hardening is
layered — no single control is load-bearing:

**Application (`main.go`)**
- **No auth by design.** Clients connect with the SSH `none` method. There is
  no shell, no filesystem access, no `exec` — the only thing a session can do is
  drive the TUI.
- **PTY gate** (`activeterm`): non-interactive `exec`/subsystem attempts are
  rejected before reaching the app.
- **Port forwarding disabled**: no `direct-tcpip`/`tcpip-forward` callbacks are
  registered, which is deny-by-default in `charmbracelet/ssh`. No tunneling.
- **Panic isolation** (`recover`): one bad session can't crash the process and
  drop everyone else.
- **Per-IP rate limiting** (`ratelimiter`): caps connection churn from a single
  source (1/s, burst 3).
- **Timeouts**: 5-minute idle, 30-minute absolute.
- **Modern crypto**: the pinned `golang.org/x/crypto` (≥ 0.50) defaults to
  curve25519 KEX, AES-GCM / ChaCha20-Poly1305, ed25519 host key. Terrapin
  (CVE-2023-48795) is mitigated upstream. Keeping this dependency current is the
  single most important ongoing task — Go's SSH transport has a mature
  disclose-and-patch pipeline, which only helps if you pull the patches.

**OS (`deploy/vieko-ssh.service`)**
- Dedicated unprivileged `vieko-ssh` user, `nologin` shell.
- Binds a high port (2222), so **zero capabilities** are needed
  (`CapabilityBoundingSet=`).
- Full systemd sandbox: `ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges`,
  `PrivateTmp/Devices`, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`, `RestrictAddressFamilies`,
  `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`, memory/task/fd caps.
- `Restart=on-failure` with a start-limit — supervised recovery without a hot
  crash loop.

**Network (`deploy/nftables.conf`)**
- Per-source new-connection rate limiting at the firewall (primary DoS defense).
- Public `:22` is redirected to `:2222`; your **admin OpenSSH is moved to
  `:2200`, key-only** — fail2ban belongs on *that* port (failed auth is a
  concept there; it isn't on the anonymous TUI port).
- Pair with the free Hetzner Cloud Firewall in front of the box.

### Why Go + wish (not Node + ssh2)

Both can do this. Go won narrowly on two axes: `x/crypto/ssh` (what `wish` sits
on) has a mature, well-scrutinized security process with a real disclosure
pipeline, and `wish` gives the hardening as composable middleware
(`recover`, `ratelimiter`, `activeterm`) rather than hand-rolled guards — which
matters when the input is anonymous and adversarial. `ssh2` is a fine,
single-maintainer pure-JS library, but its risk surface (a history of
crash-on-malformed-input issues, one process serving everyone) is a poorer fit
for this specific threat model.

## Deploy to Hetzner

One-time setup on a fresh box (Debian/Ubuntu):

```sh
# 0. Move your admin SSH off :22 BEFORE touching the firewall, so you don't
#    lock yourself out. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config: `Port 2200`, `PasswordAuthentication no`.
sudo systemctl reload ssh
# reconnect on :2200 and confirm it works before continuing.

# 1. Service user + state dir
sudo useradd --system --home /var/lib/vieko-ssh --create-home \
  --shell /usr/sbin/nologin vieko-ssh

# 2. Firewall (redirects :22 -> :2222, rate limits, keeps :2200 for admin)
sudo cp deploy/nftables.conf /etc/nftables.conf
sudo systemctl enable --now nftables

# 3. First deploy (builds, uploads, installs the unit, starts it)
VIEKO_SSH_DEPLOY_HOST=you@vieko.dev VIEKO_SSH_ADMIN_PORT=2200 ./deploy/deploy.sh
```

Then point DNS `A`/`AAAA` for `vieko.dev` (or a subdomain) at the box. Also add
the same rules to the **Hetzner Cloud Firewall** for defense in depth, and
consider restricting `:2200` to your own IP there.

Subsequent deploys are just:

```sh
VIEKO_SSH_DEPLOY_HOST=you@vieko.dev ./deploy/deploy.sh
```

## Updating content

`internal/content/content.go` is hand-mirrored from
[`vieko.dev`'s `src/lib/posts.ts`](https://github.com/vieko/vieko.dev/blob/main/src/lib/posts.ts)
and kept in sync with `vieko-cli`'s `src/data.js`. No fetch/build coupling —
update the `Posts` slice by hand when new writing ships.
